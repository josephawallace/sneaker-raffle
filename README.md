Buy tickets for the chance to win a pair of the featured sneaker. Once the target number of tickets has been purchased, the raffle is closed and the winner is announced.

## What is Snaque?

Snaque is an online sneaker raffle. Prices of hype/collectable sneakers exceedingly tend to be out of reach for the average consumer. Raffles offer an opportunity for everyone to own a pair of the most coveted releases, without spending a fortune. Snaque will continually post a featured sneaker to be raffled and won by one lucky ticket holder. Using blockchain, Snaque is able to accept tickets and select a winner in a completely transparent manner, eliminating the risk of foul play. Head over to [snaque.io](https://snaque.io) and try it out on the *Ropsten Testnet*!
